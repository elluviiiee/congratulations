I know I shouldn’t be the one saying this anymore, but my heart won’t let me stay silent. I am so proud of you, even after everything that happened between us. Our story may have ended, but my admiration for you never did.

Saksi ang langit kung gaano mo pinaghirapan lahat ng ito — the sleepless nights, the countless sacrifices, and the tears you never let anyone see. I’ve witnessed the strength you carry, the determination that pushes you forward, and the heart that never gives up, even when life gets unbearably heavy. You deserve this moment more than anyone else, and I hope you never forget how far you’ve come.

It hurts, honestly, knowing I’m no longer the person standing by your side, clapping the loudest for you. I used to imagine being there in your proudest moments, and now I can only watch from a distance. But even from afar, my chest still swells with pride for you, because I know how much you’ve worked for this and how much you deserve it.

This victory is yours, and no one can ever take that away from you. I just want you to know that even though we broke apart, my belief in you will never fade. You are someone I will always look up to, someone I will always admire, and someone who will always hold a special place in my heart.

Congratulations again. May you continue to soar higher, chase your dreams, and embrace every success that comes your way. Even if I’m not beside you anymore, I will always be proud of you.
